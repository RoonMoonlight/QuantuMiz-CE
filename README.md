# Kosmos - The community-made alternative modpack for Minecraft
Kosmos is the PvP-focused modpack for Minecraft: Java Edition, aims to be community-made alternative to [Badlion Client](https://www.badlion.net/) and [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/).

This modpack currently supports from 1.19 to 1.19.2! If the mod says it is not compatible due to minor update, feel free use old version in the meantime.
